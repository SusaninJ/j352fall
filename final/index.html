<p>After a successful first season under head coach Meg Ryan Nemzer, Maryland Women’s Soccer took a small step back in 2023. In 2022, the Terps won three games in conference play. In 2023, they didn’t win a single one. In addition, they couldn’t even score a goal in conference play.</p>
<p>The year started with high hopes for the Terps.They brought in an elite class of freshman, headlined by defender Kennedy Bell, that was ranked top 10 in the country and best in the Big Ten. They also brought in a strong class of transfers with former Santa Clara defender Eden White, former North Carolina midfielder Lauren Wrigley, former Notre Dame defender Katie Coyle, former UMBC defender Caroline Koutsos, and former Georgia goalkeeper Liz Beardsley all coming to College Park. Expectations were high for this program on the rise.</p>
<p>The Terps played a relatively strong non-conference schedule with a power conference road game against Florida and many local showdowns featured. After a start to the year that featured a loss to Florida and draws with American, Navy, James Madison, and VCU, the Terps quickly turned things around to end their non-conference slate. They returned home to face Towson and got their first win of the year over the Tigers. They won 1-0 on a goal from sophomore Ava Morales that featured a fantastic assist from the freshman phenom Kennedy Bell. The Terps then wrapped up their non-conference schedule with wins over George Mason and Binghamton. The star of the show for the Terps was Morales who had scored in all three wins. In addition, freshman Lisa McIntyre was making a nice early impression on Terps fans with two goals and an assist.</p>

<p>Big Ten play started with maybe the toughest game on the Terps schedule, a road test at national power Penn State. The Terps dropped that one 4-0 and their free fall started. Their only non-loss was a 0-0 tie against Purdue. There were some close calls, Rutgers and Ohio State beat the Terps at Ludwig Field on last minute goals, but the Terps could never find a way to break through and get the win. Coach Meg Ryan Nemzer said after the season’s last game, a 2-0 loss to nationally ranked Indiana, “This is the season that’s going to ignite us.” With such a young team, it’s easy to see why she said that.

<p>The Terps bring back plenty of talent from this year’s roster in 2024, including Bell, who was a Big Ten All-Freshman Team selection, the first such honor for any Maryland player since joining the conference in 2014. In addition, the Terps are bringing in another elite recruiting class. This one, ranked nineteenth nationally according to TopDrawerSoccer. It is headlined by Bethesda native Gemma Davitan, a midfielder who TopDrawerSoccer ranked as the 58th best prospect in the high school class.</p>

<p>There was one staff change for the Terps after the season. Assistant Coach and Recruiting Coordinator Alex Ng announced that he would be leaving Maryland to move back to Florida to be closer with his family. He will be replaced by former Maryland men’s soccer midfielder Michael Marchiano. Marchiano was previously the men’s soccer coach at Drexel University with many other assistant stops on the way. This is his first role in women’s soccer.</p>

<p>While the 2023 season may have been a disappointing one, the squad and coaching staff is looking forward to a more successful 2024 season. Coach Nemzer has talked about a championship mindset with her team a lot, their next opportunity to put that championship mindset towards championships will come next fall.</p>
