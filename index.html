<p> Jacob Ramsey is a English soccer player for Premier League club Aston Villa. He has been with the Villa academy since he was six years old and worked his way up to being a star for the senior team and a fan favorite. Ramsey made his debut with Villa in 2019, when the club was still in the second tier EFL Championship. Jacob found game time harder to come by when Villa were promoted to the Premier League. In January of 2020, Villa's first season back in the Premier League, Jacob was sent on loan to third tier side Doncaster Rovers. Ramsey shined at Doncaster, however he only was able to play seven games due to the season being canceled after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Ramsey returned to Villa ahead of the 2020-21 season when his breakthrough began. He slowly began picking up more substitute appearances through the fall before making his first start in December against local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers. In February of 2021, Jacob's good performances were rewarded with a new four and a half year contract. Jacob kept getting better in his second full season. He scored his first goal for Villa in a losing effort at Arsenal. He went on to score five more in another succcessful season for himself and Villa. 2022-23 was another good season for Jacob, scoring six more Premier League goals, including a great goal against Liverpool late in the season to help Villa secure European football for the first time since 2011. While he missed the first part of the 2023-24 season with injuruy, he recently came back and scored a goal in his second game. The sky is the limit for "one of our own."</p>

<h2>England Duties</h2>

He has made 16 appearances for the under 21 team and scored 4 goals. He played for the u21s this summer at the European Under 21 Championship, scoring in England's opening match against the Czech Republic.
